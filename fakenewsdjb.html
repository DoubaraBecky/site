                <p>
                    The just concluded detty december, parte after parte has left a bitter taste in most tongues. 
                    The detty december was celebrated on a high note as participants forgot January has 3months in its month. 
                    And now the detty december crew are left with little or no drive for fasting after the parte. Speaking to news men, 
                    the secretary of the association miss Annabelle, thanked God themonths is finally coming to an end.

                <h2>dusty, breezy weather</h2>
                <p>
                    The harmattan comes in, full blown after a 2day break. 
                    citizens were excited that at least the weather will be normal again but alas, poof, 
                    it surprises  every one by coming in stronger than intended even. but the season has its own 
                    perks of coming with it the almighty agbalumo which serves as a compensation to sooth our already 
                    dry hearts.
